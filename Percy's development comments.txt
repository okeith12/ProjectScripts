My experience so far has been hellish but fun.
The first script I got working was player movement as I thought that is the most important script, at first I used transform.postion
to move the player but with the addition of rigidbody I created a more realistic style of movement
After getting the player to move, I needed the camera to follow him so I created the camera controller that follows a given target not 
just the player. I focused on making my scripts universal so it can be used on alot of different elements

the dialogue script has to be the easiest for me, after watching 20 videos and I kid you not 20!! I was able to utilize dialogue
but still at intermeidate level as I haven't done branching yet

The Music and sound effects were quite fast and easy just like making a main menu
I am currently trying to figure out a great way to make a Splash Screen but that can wait

I have dabbled with making health and player attacking which is in my player script. With health i relaized it takes a great looking texture 
such as something like a green circle that goes down after every hit but that is generic so it leaves endless possiblities

Literally last night I got the path NPC movement to work and was suprised at how easy it was, just had to understand GIZMOS

From Monday to Wednesday I spent working on the NPC movement script which I have to say was the hardest for me because unlike
the player the NPC has to be able to move around without any INPUT but with some knowledge, so the hardest part was giving brains
to animations.

Next I am debating on if I want to focus on cutscenes or turn base. I looked into cutscenes yesterday and I was lost but just need to watch about 50 videos
and read alot of the Unity forms

I have spent the past 2 weeks on Youtube and Unity as I read on the different ways to create scripts and combine the knowledge to make my scripts
such as the dialgoue script I can have it pop up as soon as talking to NPC or I can animate it to come in.

The Animation function in Unity has become my best friend but also annoys me
Well that is my Update on how everything is going!!!!!!!
